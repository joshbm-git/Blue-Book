                <h2>Full name: Joshua Bacurio Mercado</h2>
                <p>Age: 23</p>
                <p>Previous Education: Multimedia Designer</p>
                <p>Address: Fjældevænget, Århus V</p>

                <p><span> What can you do today that you were not capable of a year ago?</span>
                    <br>
                    I am a bit better at frontend coding than I was a year ago.
                </p>
                <p>If you had not chosen to study web development – what would you then have chosen?
                    <br>
                    I would've probably studied to be a teacher.

                </p>
                <p>Why did you choose to study web development?
                    <br>
                    I like designing and creating websites.

                    shop to use it in. What shop would you choose and what would you buy?
                    <br>
                    I would use it to invest in stocks.
                </p>
                <p>What is your definition of being wealthy and why?
                    <br>
                    I would define wealthy as not only having a lot of material goods but also having a lot of life
                    experiences, especially traveling.
