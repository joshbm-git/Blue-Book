                    are financially stable and healthy, wealth is being able to decide what you do with your life.
                    I desire to have enough wealth to explore the world, experince new adventures and harvest as meny
                    memories as possible.
                    Wealth is having people around you who supports you in your purpose in life and wants to be a part
                    of it.
                    <br> I feel the most rich when im full of amazing memories together with people i care about. </p>

                    I would've probably studied to be a teacher.

                    experiences, especially traveling.
