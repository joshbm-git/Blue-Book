                <h2><b>Full name:</b> <br> Oskar Wiegaard</h2>
                <p><b>Age:</b> <br> 26</p>
                <p><b>Previous Education:</b> <br> Multimediedesign</p>
                <p><b>Address:</b><br> Horsensgade, 8000 Aarhus C</p>
                <p><b>Siblings:</b> <br> 1 Sister</p>
                <p><b>What can you do today that you were not capable of a year ago?</b> <br> Photography and Lightroom
                </p>
                <p><b>If you had not chosen to study web development – what would you then have chosen?</b><br>Sports
                    Science</p>
                <p><b>Why did you choose to study web development?</b><br>As a multimediedesign student who liked
                    coding. Its the natural advancement.</p>
                <p><b>If you got a gift certificate for 5.000 kr. And it had to be used today, but you could choose any
                        shop to use it in. What shop would you choose and what would you buy?</b> <br> Im pretty have
                    with the material goods i currently posses. So i would spend it on something fun which i usually
                    wouldnt just blow my money on like a new tattoo</p>
                <p><b>What is your definition of being wealthy and why?</b><br>To me wealth is a feeling. As long as you
                    are financially stable and healthy, wealth is being able to decide what you do with your life.
                    I desire to have enough wealth to explore the world, experince new adventures and harvest as meny
                    memories as possible.
                    Wealth is having people around you who supports you in your purpose in life and wants to be a part
                    of it.
                    <br> I feel the most rich when im full of amazing memories together with people i care about. </p>

                    I am a bit better at frontend coding than I was a year ago.
                </p>
                <p><b>If you had not chosen to study web development – what would you then have chosen?</b>
                    <br>
                    I would've probably studied to be a teacher.

                </p>
                <p><b>Why did you choose to study web development?</b>
                    <br>
                    I like designing and creating websites.

                    <br>
                    I would use it to invest in stocks.

                <p><b>What is your definition of being wealthy and why?</b>
                    <br>
                    I would define wealthy as not only having a lot of material goods but also having a lot of life
                    experiences, especially traveling.
